== Installation ==

1. Upload the `woo-address-book` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Make sure you have WooCommerce installed and enabled.
3. Activate the WooCommerce Address Book through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
4. Address Book options will now appear on the customer's account page and checkout once they've entered their primary shipping address.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why can't I add a new address to my address book? =
The address book will only begin to display after the primary shipping address has been created for the customer.

= Will this plugin allow my customers to ship to multiple locations with a single order? =
No, this plugin only allows for the storage of multiple shipping addresses. If a customer would like to ship to multiple locations, they should complete multiple orders.
