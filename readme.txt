Gives your customers the option to store multiple billing and shipping addresses and retrieve them on checkout.

== Description ==

Gives your customers the option to store multiple billing and shipping addresses and retrieve them on checkout. Addresses can be updated and modified quickly and easily in /my-account/, or saved as part of the checkout process.

There is a demo setup at https://woo-address-book.hallme.com if you would like to try this plugin out with a demo store.

= Settings =

The settings for this plugin are located in WooCommerce General settings: WooCommerce -> Settings -> General.

WooCommerce Address Book options:

* Enable billing/shipping address book
* Add New Address as default selection
* Enable setting Billing/Shipping Address Nickname during Checkout

= Code =

View the source on [GitHub](https://github.com/hallme/woo-address-book). You can also submit an [issue](https://github.com/hallme/woo-address-book/issues) or pull request for anything new.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the `woo-address-book` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Make sure you have WooCommerce installed and enabled.
3. Activate the WooCommerce Address Book through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
4. Address Book options will now appear on the customer's account page and checkout once they've entered their primary billing or shipping address.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why can't I add a new address to my address book? =
The address book will only begin to display after the primary billing or shipping address has been created for the customer.

= Will this plugin allow my customers to ship to multiple locations with a single order? =
No, this plugin only allows for the storage of multiple shipping addresses. If a customer would like to ship to multiple locations, they should complete multiple orders.

= Why is the address not populating my custom fields at checkout? =
Most standard custom fields do work with the Address Book. However, if you have custom fields added by a plugin which are updated by javascript then the Address Book plugin will not always know how to handle the data. If you are running into an issue please post an issue in the [support forum](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/woo-address-book/) or on [github](https://github.com/hallme/woo-address-book/issues) with what plugin or code you are using and as much details as you can. We will determine if the Address Book plugin is able to provide support for the plugin or if a custom solution would need to be developed for your use case.

= How can I add custom fields to my billing/shipping address? =
WooCommerce Address Book uses the standard WooCommerce address functions so any method to modify the address fields will still work.
We have tested that using the standard filters works correctly:
* https://docs.woocommerce.com/document/tutorial-customising-checkout-fields-using-actions-and-filters/
We have also tested this plugin by WooCommerce:
* https://woocommerce.com/products/woocommerce-checkout-field-editor/

= How do I translate this plugin? =
We now use the new way of translating WordPress plugins at https://translate.wordpress.org/

Feel free to contribute a translation at https://translate.wordpress.org/projects/wp-plugins/woo-address-book/

= How do I get my translation approved? =
Someone needs to apply to be a translation editor for this plugin. If you have contributed a translation, you may apply to be the editor yourself.

You can make the request and that request can be approved by the WordPress Localization editors.
See here for more details: https://make.wordpress.org/polyglots/handbook/rosetta/roles-and-capabilities/pte-request/#pte-request-by-a-translator

= How can I use my translation before it is approved? =
What you can do to use it locally right now is go to the translate page.
At the bottom by the Export link, select "Only matching the filter" and "Machine Object Message Catalog (.mo)" and then click Export to download the `.mo` file.

Then save this .mo file to your WordPress site at `wp-content/languages/plugins/woo-address-book-LANGUAGE.mo` replacing `LANGUAGE` with your language code.

For example for German, you would go here:
https://translate.wordpress.org/projects/wp-plugins/woo-address-book/stable/de/default/

Then save this .mo file to your WordPress site at `wp-content/languages/plugins/woo-address-book-de_DE.mo`

You may also use PoEdit and create a translation file which can be exported as a `.mo` file to be saved in the same location.

== Screenshots ==
1. Manage your address book on the account page. Choose your primary billing address, shipping address, or add multiple alternative addresses.
2. Easily select your billing and shipping address on checkout.
